# Web Development Code Katas

This repository contains a collection of code katas designed to improve your web development skills through deliberate practice. Each kata focuses on specific aspects of web development, with an emphasis on network communication, API interactions, and server-side programming.

## What are Code Katas?

Code katas are programming exercises that help developers improve their skills through practice and repetition. Similar to martial arts katas, they provide a structured way to hone your craft by solving the same problem multiple times, each time refining your approach and technique.

## Core Principles

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All katas in this collection should be approached using Test-Driven Development:

1. **Write a failing test**: Start by writing a test that defines an expected behavior but fails because the code doesn't exist yet.
2. **Write the minimum code to pass the test**: Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up your code without changing its behavior.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the cycle with the next test.

Following the TDD approach will help you create more reliable, maintainable code and build a comprehensive test suite as you develop.

### Repetition and Mastery

The true value of katas comes from repetition:

* **Attempt each kata multiple times**: Try to solve the same kata on different days.
* **Use different approaches**: Experiment with different techniques, patterns, or technologies.
* **Time yourself**: As you become more familiar with a kata, you should be able to complete it more efficiently.
* **Reflect on improvements**: After each attempt, review what went well and what could be better.

Aim to practice regularly - even 20-30 minutes of daily practice can lead to significant improvement over time.

### Time Management and Discipline

* **Choose a time limit and stick to it**: Set a specific time constraint for each kata attempt. The recommended duration is 30 minutes.
* **Be disciplined**: Maintain focus during your practice session and avoid distractions.
* **Use a timer**: Track your time to develop a sense of how long different tasks take you.
* **Complete what you can**: If you can't finish within the time limit, reflect on what slowed you down and how you might improve next time.

This constraint helps build the ability to work efficiently and prioritize essential functionality - a crucial skill in real-world development.

## Kata Structure

Each kata in this repository follows a consistent structure:

1. **Objective**: A clear statement of what you're trying to achieve
2. **Requirements**: Specific features and functionality to implement
3. **Constraints**: Limitations or rules to follow during implementation
4. **Learning Focus**: Key skills and concepts practiced in the kata

## Available Katas

### Browser-Based
- **Simple Weather Fetcher**: A minimalist weather lookup tool with basic error handling

### Backend/Server
- **Weather Client**: Build a CLI tool that retrieves weather data using cURL
- **dataPingEcho**: Create a lightweight HTTP server that processes different types of requests
- **ioCSV**: Create a command-line tool that reads a CSV file containing sales data, processes it, and outputs calculated statistics.

## Getting Started

1. Choose a kata that matches your current learning goals
2. Create a new directory for your implementation
3. Write your first test
4. Follow the TDD cycle until you've met all requirements
5. Review your solution and reflect on what you've learned
6. Try the same kata again later, starting from scratch

## Tips for Effective Practice

- **Start small**: Begin with simpler katas and progress to more complex ones
- **Stay focused**: Keep yourself in deliberate practice mode. Pause the AI assistant.
- **Embrace constraints**: The limitations in each kata are designed to push your creativity
- **Practice regularly**: Consistent practice yields better results than occasional intense sessions

Remember, the journey is more important than the destination. The goal is not just to complete each kata, but to improve your skills and understanding through the process.

Happy coding!
