# Code Kata: Simple Weather Fetcher

## Objective
Create a minimal weather lookup tool that fetches current weather data for a single city.

## Requirements
1. Create a simple web page with:
   - An input field for city name
   - A submit button
   - A results area to display weather information

2. When the user submits a city name:
   - Make a request to a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap's free tier)
   - Display the current temperature, weather condition, and humidity
   - Show appropriate error messages if the city isn't found or the network fails

## Constraints
- Use vanilla JavaScript only (no frameworks)
- Handle all network errors gracefully
- Keep the UI simple - focus on the network interaction

## Learning Focus
- Making API requests with fetch() or XMLHttpRequest
- Handling asynchronous operations
- Basic error handling for network requests
- DOM manipulation to display results

This smaller kata focuses on the core skill of making network requests and handling responses, without getting bogged down in extended features or complex UI requirements. It's perfect for a single practice session while still covering the fundamentals of web network communication.
